# Piglet Growth Coin (PGC) Smart Contracts

**PGC** is the native token of the Piglet Growth Coin ecosystem — a gamified blockchain experience where users raise virtual piglets through realistic farming actions, and grow them into valuable crypto assets.

## 🐷 What is PGC?

Piglet Growth Coin simulates daily farm activity — feeding, vaccinating, deworming, and growing piglets into fully grown pigs. After 3 months, pigs mature into valuable coins. Users can continue growing, breed them to mint NFT piglets, or trade ecosystem resources.
